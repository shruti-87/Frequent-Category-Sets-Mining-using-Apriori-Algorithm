# Frequent-Category-Sets-Mining-using-Apriori-Algorithm
This Python project implements the Apriori algorithm for mining frequent category sets in a dataset. The goal is to extract category sets that have an absolute support count of at least 771. It's designed for data mining and market basket analysis, making it a valuable tool for extracting insights from large datasets.
